# com.telerik.dropbox

The plugin is based on Dropbox Sync API.The Sync API takes care of syncing all your data with Dropbox through a familiar, file system-like interface. It's like giving your app its own, private Dropbox client.

The plugin defines a global `dropbox` object, which defines operations to setup and save files to your Dropbox folder.

Although the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(device.cordova);
    }

## Installation

You need to obtain dropbox APP_KEY and APP_SECRET. This will be prompted as you try to install the plugin. You can obtain these keys from the Dropbox [developer portal](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) under _App Console_:

Once you have your keys, you can install the plugin as follows:

    cordova plugin add url -â€”variable APP_KEY=# ---variable APP_SECRET=#

## Methods

- dropbox.linkAccount
- dropbox.linkedAccounts
- dropbox.save


## dropbox.linkAccount

Starts the authentication process to link a account.If your app is already linked, you can call this method again to prompt the user to link a different account, allowing your app to use multiple accounts at once (e.g. a personal and a business account).

	dropbox.linkAccount();
	
## dropbox.linkedAccounts

Returns all currently linked Dropbox accounts. If no accounts have been linked, this method will return an empty list.

The accounts are ordered from the least recently to the most recently linked.'

	dropbox.linkedAccounts(function(accounts){
		alert(JSON.stringify(accounts));
	});


## dropbox.save

	    content,
